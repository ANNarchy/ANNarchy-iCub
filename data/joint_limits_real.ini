; The following data are the joint limits for the iCub. Here, the minimum and maximum value is given.
; The data is retrieved from the iCub-simulator. In the simulator files (directory: icub-main/app/simConfig/conf, 
; with icub-main as main directory of the simulator repository) for every robot part an ini file with the joint limits is given. 
; In order to ensure a save usage with the real robot, the values should be compared to the values in the robot documentation to avoid collisions.
